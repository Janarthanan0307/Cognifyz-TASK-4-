# Geographical Analysis of Restaurant Locations

## Overview

This repository contains code and resources for analyzing the geographical distribution of restaurants based on their latitude and longitude coordinates. The goal is to gain insights into restaurant concentrations, average ratings, and other relevant statistics across different areas.

## Dataset

- **Dataset Source**: [Insert dataset source link here]
- **Description**: The dataset includes information about various restaurants, their locations, and other relevant features.
- **Features**: Latitude, longitude, city, locality, average ratings, cuisines, price ranges, etc.

## Steps

1. **Exploring Coordinates and Visualization**:
   - Start by examining the latitude and longitude coordinates of each restaurant. These coordinates represent their geographical locations.
   - Visualize their distribution on a map (e.g., using libraries like Folium, Plotly, or Matplotlib).

2. **Grouping by City or Locality**:
   - Group the restaurants based on their city or locality. This will help you understand the concentration of restaurants in different areas.
   - Calculate the total number of restaurants in each city or locality.

3. **Calculating Statistics**:
   - Calculate relevant statistics for each city or locality:
     - **Average Ratings**: Compute the average ratings of restaurants in each area.
     - **Cuisines**: Identify the most popular cuisines in different localities.
     - **Price Ranges**: Analyze the distribution of price ranges (e.g., cheap, moderate, expensive) across locations.

4. **Identifying Insights and Patterns**:
   - Look for interesting patterns related to restaurant locations:
     - Are certain cities or neighborhoods more restaurant-dense?
     - Do highly-rated restaurants tend to cluster in specific areas?
     - Are there any cuisine preferences based on location?

## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Python (with necessary libraries for data analysis and visualization).
   - Install required packages (e.g., pandas, geopandas, folium).

2. **Data Exploration and Visualization**:
   - Load your dataset.
   - Explore the coordinates and create visualizations.

3. **Grouping and Statistics**:
   - Group restaurants by city or locality.
   - Calculate relevant statistics.

4. **Documentation**:
   - Document your process, code, and findings in a README file.
   - Include details about data preprocessing, analysis, and any interesting patterns discovered.
